        text: 'From both a 1 to 1 session and a group enviroment, Babette creates an informative, calm & safe space. All my inquisitive questions were answered thoroughly some with great analogies, each time I attend a session my body reacts differently which Babette explained clearly which has helped me get the most from my sessions. I would fully recommend anyone considering embarking on TRE to attend Babettes class to explore the many positives that TRE creates. It\'s the most fantastic gentle self tool you can have. Babette has a very gently, likeable & playful approach with her tuition. I now cant imagine a world without TRE',

        text: 'I feel so grateful to have discovered Babette and her TRE classes. I have done both one on one and group sessions with her. She is an excellent teacher. I have learnt so much about releasing Trauma from the body. I have had a lot of trauma in my life and to find a way of letting go of it is wonderful. Babette always says, trauma can be a car crash or someone shouting at you at work. It\'s all trauma and unless released, will stay in the body, looking for a way of releasing it. It is a simple technique and easy to learn. Once your body recognises it, it will shake out trauma and you feel lighter, happier and things that once caused you stress will seem less potent. I love it and will practice it for the rest of my life. Thank you Babette for teaching me such a life changing tool.',

        text: 'Babette\'s TRE sessions are awesome, she very quickly puts you at ease. I do both in person and online sessions and Babette creates a safe place for me to get in to my body, get grounded and let go of any tension or stress Ive been hanging on to. TRE has helped me be more open to my mind-body connection, to listen to what my body needs and to be kind to myself. Babette offers advice and guidance that\'s right for me in the moment, makes it ok to laugh or cry, whatever I need to be at the time. Babette has such a beautiful approach to TRE, I feel totally safe and in control at all times, ready to let things go. I love shaking with Babette, she\'s brilliant.',

For this, I have Babette to thank: her calm and easy tuition-style helped me to quickly get to grips with the TRE exercise regime. Definitely recommended if you would like to see what TRE can do for you.',

Babette has a kind, caring nature and guides the TRE classes in a relaxed, calm manner, covering all eventualities with her professional knowledge. Thanks you for introducing me to TRE, Babette!',

        text: 'I have been to a few of Babette’s online TRE classes which are ideal for me as I live too far away to attend in person.  Babette explains the process thoroughly and it’s very easy to understand and follow the exercises.  Nothing is rushed and Babette takes the time to ensure everyone is following the exercises correctly.  It’s not too strenuous and I’ve felt a lot of tension release by the end and have always slept incredibly well afterwards.  Babette is friendly and engaging and I would highly recommend TRE to anyone looking for a simple and effective way to combat stress and tension.',
